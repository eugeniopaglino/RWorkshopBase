# Introduction to R Workshop

Introduction to R and the `tidyverse` workshop for Demography and Sociology students at the University of Pennsylvania. You can see the slides [here](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/eugeniopaglino/RWorkshopBase/blob/main/RWorkshopBase.html).

If you want to dowload all of this repository's code to your own machine, you should open a Terminal sessions (if on Mac) or a Command Prompt (if on Windows) and type the following commands:

```
# Travel to the folder where you want to dowload the repository. 
# The repository will create its own folder so you should not create one.

cd pathToFolder

# Your path should look something like:

/Users/username/Documents/myGitHubProjects/ # Mac users
C:\Documents\myGitHubProjects\ # Windows users

# Download a repository hosted on GitHub to our machine

git clone https://github.com/eugeniopaglino/RWorkshopBase.git

# This works for any repository, you just need to replace `owner/repo` 
# with the owner and name of the repository to clone
```

During this workshop, I won't be going into how Git and GitHub work but you can learn more [here](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/using-git/about-git). Don't be intimidated by the need to use the command line, it's just a different way to interact with your machine that does not rely on a graphical interface. However, if you encounter a problem, beware of solutions found of the web that you do not understand (expecially when the `sudo` command is involved. You might inadvertently end up messing with you operative system in undesirable ways.
