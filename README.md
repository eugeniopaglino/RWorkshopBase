Introduction to R and the `tidyverse` workshop for Demography and Sociology students at the University of Pennsylvania. You can see the slides [here](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/eugeniopaglino/RWorkshopBase/blob/main/RWorkshopBase.html)

If you want to dowload all of this repository's code to your own machine, you should open a Terminal sessions (if on Mac) or a Command Prompt (if on Windows) and type the following commands:

```
# Travel to the folder where you want to dowload the repository. The repository will create its own folder so you should not create one.
cd pathToFolder

# download a repository on GitHub to our machine
# Replace `owner/repo` with the owner and name of the repository to clone
git clone https://github.com/eugeniopaglino/RWorkshopBase.git
```

During this workshop, I won't be going into how Git and GitHub work but you can learn more [here](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/using-git/about-git). You can also find a cheatsheet to help you rebember what each command does [here](https://education.github.com/git-cheat-sheet-education.pdf) or [here](https://girliemac.com/blog/2017/12/26/git-purr/) if you are a visual person and love cats. Don't be intimidated by the need to interact with the command line, it's just a different way to interact with your machine that does not rely on a graphical interface. However, beware of solutions found of the web that you do not understand.
